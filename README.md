## K-9 Mail Hacked
Version of K-9 Mail 5.600 with added support for conscrypt (for TLS 1.2 on Android 4.x) and old icon.

This project is for private purposes (but somebody may find it helpful) and it is not
going to be updated at all so if you can (Android >= 5 and/or no need for TLS 1.2) use
original K-9 Mail https://github.com/k9mail/k-9.
